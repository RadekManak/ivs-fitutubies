-Chosen channels for communication and given rules for communication:
We have chosen the Discord platform as a main tool for communication. Our team has already cooperated during the first semester, therefore it was not necessary to find a new way of exchanging information suitable to all members. We have created a separate channel for the project purposes.
There was also a Trello dashboard created. This one is a designated place for assignment of individual tasks, setting proper deadlines, offering an easy access to the current state of the project.

—Chosen hosting and system for the version management
We have agreed on using the Git and GitHub platforms for the management of versions. In order to avoid possibility of potential repository damage by improper usage of Git (e.g. Rebase/Force push) the branch protect would be used on the master branch. In addition, this precaution would also ensure the quality of our cooperation.
All the commits have to undergo the code review process and have to be approved by at least one member of the team.

All the commit messages are required to comply with the rules stated in the article [1] written by Chris Beams. The feature branch workflow will be employed in our project [2].
